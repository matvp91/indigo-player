00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000 a:start
<v Proog>At the <i>left</i> we can see...</v>

2
00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.083
At the <i>right</i> we can <u>see</u> the...

3
00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:22.000
...the <b>head-snarlers</b></v>

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.417
<v Proog>Everything is safe. Perfectly safe.</v>

5
00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:27.083
Emo?

6
00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:30.042
Watch out!

7
00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.542
Are you hurt?

8
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Emo>I don't think so. You?</v>

9
00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:57.042
I'm Ok.

10
00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:01.167
Get up. Emo, it's not safe here.

11
00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:03.167
Let's go.

12
00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:05.167
What's next?

13
00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:09.208
You'll see!

14
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
(howling wind)

15
00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:18.083
Emo. This way.

16
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.542
Follow me!

17
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
(buzzing wires and chattery conversations)

18
00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:12.542
Hurry Emo!

19
00:02:20.292 --> 00:02:22.792
(louder telephone voices)

20
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.500
(phone ringing)

21
00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:50.000
You're not paying attention!

22
00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:54.125
I just want to answer the... ...phone.

23
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.042
Emo, look, I mean listen.

24
00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:02.083
You have to learn to listen.

25
00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:05.042
This is not some game.

26
00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:09.417
You, i mean we, we could easily die out here.

27
00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:14.042
Listen, listen to the sounds of the machine.

28
00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.083
Listen to your breathing.

29
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
(Buzzing wires)

30
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.500
(laughing)

31
00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:15.417
(oriental dance music)

32
00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:29.042
Well, don't you ever get tired of this?

33
00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:31.000
Tired?!?

34
00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:34.583
Emo, the machine is like clockwork.

35
00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:37.167
One move out of place...

36
00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:39.208
...and you're ground to a pulp.

37
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.083
But isn't it -

38
00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:46.125
Pulp, Emo! Is that what you want, pulp?

39
00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:49.083
Emo, your goal in life...

40
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.042
...pulp?

41
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.500
(loud metal sounds)

42
00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:43.125
Emo, close your eyes.

43
00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:46.125
Why? - Now!

44
00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:52.208
Ok.

45
00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:54.792
Good.

46
00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:02.208
What do you see at your left side, Emo?

47
00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:06.000
Nothing. - Really?

48
00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:07.208
No, nothing at all.

49
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.083
And at your right, what do you see at your right side, Emo?

50
00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:16.208
The same Proog, exactly the same...

51
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.208
...nothing! - Great.

52
00:06:25.208 --> 00:06:27.208
(sound of camera flash)

53
00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:31.792
(engine drone)

54
00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:42.833
Listen Proog! Do you hear that! (amusement park music)

55
00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:45.000
Can we go here?

56
00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:48.000
There? It isn't safe, Emo.

57
00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:52.125
But... - Trust me, it's not.

58
00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:54.208
Maybe I could...

59
00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:56.083
No.

60
00:06:57.167 --> 00:07:00.042
NO!

61
00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:03.167
Any further questions, Emo?

62
00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:05.208
No.

63
00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:10.208
Emo?

64
00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:13.125
Emo, why...

65
00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:14.125
Emo...

66
00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:18.125
...why can't you see the beauty of this place?

67
00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:20.167
The way it works.

68
00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:24.000
How perfect it is.

69
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.083
No, Proog, I don't see.

70
00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:30.083
I don't see because there's nothing there.

71
00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:35.083
And why should I trust my life to something that isn't there?

72
00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:37.042
Well can you tell me that?

73
00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:39.042
Answer me!

74
00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:44.125
Proog...

75
00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:47.083
...you're a sick man!

76
00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:49.042
Stay away from me!

77
00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:55.000
No! Emo! It's a trap!

78
00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:57.042
Hah, it's a trap.

79
00:07:57.042 --> 00:08:01.167
At the left side you can see the hanging gardens of Babylon!

80
00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:04.083
How's that for a trap?

81
00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:07.042
No, Emo.

82
00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:12.208
At the right side you can see... ...well guess what...

83
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.792
...the colossus of Rhodes!

84
00:08:15.208 --> 00:08:16.167
No!

85
00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:22.042
The colossus of Rhodes and it is here just for you Proog.

86
00:08:51.083 --> 00:08:53.042
It is there...

87
00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:56.167
I'm telling you, Emo...

88
00:08:57.083 --> 00:09:00.000
...it is.

89
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.500
(howling wind)
