## Getting started

**In a browser**

The example below will load a simple MP4 file, and attempt to autoplay it.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="playerContainer"></div>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/indigo-player@1/lib/indigo-player.js"></script>
    <script>
      const config = {
        sources: [
          {
            type: 'mp4',
            src: 'https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4',
          }
        ],
      };

      const element = document.getElementById('playerContainer');
      const player = IndigoPlayer.init(element, config);

      // You can use the player object now to access the player and it's methods (play, pause, ...)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**As a module in your bundle**

The example below will add `indigo-player` as a module in your project.

```
yarn add indigo-player
```

```
npm i indigo-player
```

```javascript
import IndigoPlayer from "indigo-player";
// Bundle the css file too, or provide your own.
import "indigo-player/lib/indigo-theme.css";

const player = IndigoPlayer.init(container, config);
```
